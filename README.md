# Java Game Project - Zelda (NES) Clone üïπÔ∏è

This project is game we created using Java with Swing only. This is a really barebone clone of the original Zelda game from NES, with every asset other than sound effects and music created by me. (Thanks to Koji Kondo!) 

## How to run it?
This is a Java project created with IntelliJ IDE, so launching the project with it should be fine. Every asset from sprites to fonts are all included in the project and ready to play! Note that doing everything only takes about 3 - 4 minutes.

## How to play
- Control your character with WASD or arrow keys.
- Use your tools with Space key.
- Change your tools with R key.
- There are 5 items total with 4 of them you should collect on your own.
- Attack red slimes to kill them.
- There is no end goal, you just roam around and collect items. When you die you have to restart the game.

## Issues
This project was my term project, so it was created in a week. You've been warned, do not expect an optimized and fun game.

##

Feel free to use anything from this project other than sound effects and music. Even the font is created by me, have fun.
